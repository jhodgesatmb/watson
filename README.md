Scaffolding to test IBM ecosystem integration with database access and deployment to a web service

The 2 scripts in this repository, watson_endpoint.js and watson_endpoint.py were created by ChatGPT with two requests:

Python: write a python script that builds a web service that integrates IBM Watson Assistant, IBM Watson Discovery, and IBM Watson Neuroseek
NodeJS: write a nodejs script that builds a web service that integrates IBM Watson Assistant, IBM Watson Discovery, IBM Watson Neuroseek, and MySQL

The results of these requests were the two scripts in this repository, which I tweaked a bit. ChatGPT also told me which libraries had to be installed and how to get them, which I did.

After that I asked ChatGPT other questions relating to deployment and execution which it answered.

IBM asked for this repository and the python requirements.txt file and the nodejs package.json file. I created the form with the 'pip3 freeze > requirements.txt' command and I used the 'npm init' command to create the latter.

I am getting package import errors at the top of the python script and, if I recall, in the nodejs script.
