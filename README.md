# Watson Test Scaffolding
Scaffolding to test IBM ecosystem integration with database access and deployment to a web service

The 2 scripts in this repository, watson_endpoint.js and watson_endpoint.py were created by ChatGPT with two requests:

## Python

**ChatGPT Request**: *Write a python script that builds a web service that integrates IBM Watson Assistant, IBM Watson Discovery, and IBM Watson Neuroseek*

This produced the watson_endpoint.py script, which I tweaked a bit. ChatGPT also provided the following text:

This script sets up an HTTP endpoint at /chat that accepts POST requests with a JSON payload containing the user's input. It uses the IBM Watson Assistant service to generate a response, the IBM Watson Discovery service to search for relevant information, and the IBM Watson Neuroseek service to perform additional analysis. The script then constructs a JSON response containing the assistant's response, the discovery results, and the Neuroseek results.

Note that you will need to have the ibm-watson package installed (pip install ibm-watson) as well as the Flask framework (pip install flask) to run this script. Also, make sure you have valid credentials and service URLs for IBM Watson Assistant, IBM Watson Discovery, and IBM Watson Neuroseek.

**ChatGPT Request**: *how do I install this script on localhost*

and got the following response:

To run the script on your localhost, follow these steps:

1.1 Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

1.2 Install required packages: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the Python script. Run the following command to install the required packages:

pip install flask ibm-watson

1.3 Replace credentials: Update the script with your actual credentials for IBM Watson Assistant, IBM Watson Discovery, and IBM Watson Neuroseek. Replace the placeholder values 'YOUR_ASSISTANT_API_KEY', 'YOUR_ASSISTANT_URL', 'YOUR_ASSISTANT_ID', 'YOUR_DISCOVERY_API_KEY', 'YOUR_DISCOVERY_URL', 'YOUR_DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID', 'YOUR_DISCOVERY_COLLECTION_ID', 'YOUR_NEUROSEEK_API_KEY', and 'YOUR_NEUROSEEK_URL' with your real credentials.

1.4 Save the script: Ensure that you have saved the script with a .py file extension, such as app.py.

1.5 Run the script: In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the script is located. Run the following command to start the web service:

Copy code
python app.py
You should see output indicating that the Flask development server is running.

1.6 Access the web service: Open a web browser and enter http://localhost:5000 in the address bar. This will connect to the web service running on your localhost.

1.7 Test the web service: To test the web service, you can use a tool like cURL or send HTTP POST requests from your application. You can send a JSON payload to the /chat endpoint, as shown in the example script, to interact with the service.

Remember to keep the script running in the terminal or command prompt as long as you want the web service to be accessible. You can stop the script by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal.

Note: Running the web service on your localhost is suitable for development and testing purposes. If you want to make the service accessible to others on the network or deploy it to a production environment, you will need to follow additional steps, such as deploying it to a hosting service or configuring a web server.

## NodeJS

**ChatGPT Request**: *Write a nodejs script that builds a web service that integrates IBM Watson Assistant, IBM Watson Discovery, IBM Watson Neuroseek, and MySQL*

The results of this request was the watson_endpoint.js script, which I tweaked a bit. ChatGPT also provided the following:

Please note that this script assumes you have installed the required npm packages (ibm-watson, mysql, express, and body-parser). If not, you can install them using the following commands:

bash
Copy code
npm install ibm-watson mysql express body-parser
Also, replace the placeholders 'YOUR_ASSISTANT_API_KEY', 'YOUR_ASSISTANT_URL', 'YOUR_ASSISTANT_ID', 'YOUR_DISCOVERY_API_KEY', 'YOUR_DISCOVERY_URL', 'YOUR_DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID', 'YOUR_DISCOVERY_COLLECTION_ID', 'YOUR_NEUROSEEK_API_KEY', 'YOUR_NEUROSEEK_URL', 'YOUR_MYSQL_HOST', 'YOUR_MYSQL_USER', 'YOUR_MYSQL_PASSWORD', and 'YOUR_MYSQL_DATABASE' with your actual credentials and MySQL connection information.

Keep in mind that this script provides a basic example of how to integrate these IBM Watson services and MySQL in a Node.js web service. Depending on your specific use case and requirements, you may need to modify and expand the code accordingly.

**ChatGPT Request**: *how do I execute this script*

ChatGPT responded as follows:

To execute the Node.js script, follow these steps:

2.1 Save the script: Copy the entire Node.js script provided in the previous response and save it in a file with a .js extension, for example, app.js.

2.2 Install dependencies: Before running the script, ensure you have installed the required npm packages. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where app.js is saved, and run the following command:

css
Copy code
npm install ibm-watson mysql express body-parser
This will install the necessary dependencies (ibm-watson, mysql, express, and body-parser) in your project directory.

2.3 Set credentials and MySQL connection info: Replace the placeholder values in the script with your actual IBM Watson and MySQL credentials. Update the following lines with the correct values:

IBM Watson Assistant: assistantApiKey, assistantUrl, assistantVersion, assistantAssistantId
IBM Watson Discovery: discoveryApiKey, discoveryUrl, discoveryEnvironmentId, discoveryCollectionId
IBM Watson Neuroseek: neuroseekApiKey, neuroseekUrl
MySQL Connection: dbConfig (host, user, password, database)

2.4 Run the script: Once you have set up the script with the correct credentials, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing app.js, and run the following command:

Copy code
node app.js
This will start the Node.js web service, and you should see a message in the console indicating that the server is running on http://localhost:3000.

2.5 Test the web service: With the server running, you can now test the web service by sending HTTP POST requests to the endpoint /chat with JSON payloads containing the user input. You can use tools like Postman, cURL, or a web application to interact with the web service and receive responses from IBM Watson services and MySQL.

Please note that this example assumes that you have already obtained valid API keys and service URLs for IBM Watson services and valid MySQL connection information. If you haven't obtained them yet, you'll need to sign up for IBM Watson services and set up a MySQL database accordingly.

Also, keep in mind that this script is a basic example and may require further modification and error handling depending on your specific use case and requirements.

After that I asked ChatGPT other questions relating to deployment and execution which it answered.

IBM asked for this repository and the python requirements.txt file and the nodejs package.json file. I created the form with the 'pip3 freeze > requirements.txt' command and I used the 'npm init' command to create the latter.

I am getting package import errors at the top of the python script and, if I recall, in the nodejs script.
